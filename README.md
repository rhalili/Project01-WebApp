        <p>
            I am a National Security professional with experience that spans managing investigations as an FBI Special Agent
            to processing and disseminating intelligence as an Analyst for the Intelligence Community.
            <br><br>
            I am currently engaged in a cohort with the University of California Berkeley focused on Cybersecurity to focus my
            capabilities towards threats in the cyber realm.

                <h3>Time To Accept the Passkey</h3>
                <h4>Cryptography</h4>
                <p>The password is dead, long live the passkey. The ubiquitous password has served its purpose. 
                   The days of racking your brain over what you changed your password needs to come to an end. 
                   Segue, the Passkey. In a nut shell, Passkeys are more secure than a password or any machination of the like. 
                   I can recall during my first online experience deciding on a password that was 'unique' and 'difficult' to break, 
                   subsequently falling to the lazy one password for all model. This has been a boon for hackers for years, 
                   i.e. RockYou file. Today, the cyber space landscape is the Wild Wild West and has seen several of its own
                   never ending wars. A step in the right direction should be the acceptance of the Passkey. The reason passkeys are 
                   considered more secure is due to the fact that a hacker requires both a public key and a private which is stored 
                   on a user's personal device. It's like having a special handshake with another person while they look into your full 
                   bright eyes knowing full well that biometrically you're you, a physical 2-Factor Authentication. With that said, getting
                   companies, let alone people, to fully embrace new, more secure technology is like going to the dentist. [Side bar, I
                   have a friend that actually goes to the dentist four times a year.] It's high time we slow down the threat that hackers
                   pose to our safety on-line, moreover, our bank accounts. I acknowledge that nothing online is fully safe, but the 
                   general consensus from all disgraced nuclear physicists driving Deloreans, is that Passkeys will make the internet a
                   little safer. Now, I'm off to help a Nigerian Prince.

                <h3>Secure AI</h3>
                <h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>
                <p>Everyone and their mother is looking for their in regarding 'AI', not the movie with the 'I see dead people' kid. [I was
                   looking for my way out...of the theater]. Big Tech is scrambling to apply security functions to their AI tools to
                   protect from hackers developing even more sophisticated cyber threats. We've seen it online, time and time again, at the
                   speed in which companies are trying to push the latest and greatest, security is often an afterthought. Big Tech should
                   be more cognizant to hackers utilizing AI for nefarious gain. It is more evident nowadays that not only should Cyber
                   Security professionals should be ahead of the threat, but the general public needs a cursory knowledge of cyber tools to
                   keep in front of emerging techonology, more importantly, their interwoven threats. Google is taking concurrent steps to 
                   keep at pace with emerging threats posed by hackers by implementing an array of established standards when forging 
                   forward with AI - adopting pentesting along side code development, automating cyber defenses to identify anomalies, 
                   recurring reviews of their protection sets, doubling down on threat intelligence research. The godfather of AI, and 
                   Ex-Googler Geoffrey Hinton, stepped
                   down from his position at Google so he could speak freely about the threats (most of which are existential) posed by AI.
                   So there are people speaking out and Big Tech acknowledges missteps in 'Moving Fast & Breaking Things'.
